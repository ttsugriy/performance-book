# Glossary {.unnumbered}

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the book. Terms are organized alphabetically.

---

**Arithmetic Intensity**
: The ratio of floating-point operations to bytes transferred from memory. Measured in FLOPS/byte. High arithmetic intensity operations are compute-bound; low arithmetic intensity operations are memory-bound. See @sec-bandwidth.

**Associativity**
: A mathematical property where $(a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c)$ for some operation $\oplus$. Enables chunked and parallel processing because results can be combined in any order. The foundation of streaming algorithms and online computations.

**Bandwidth**
: The rate at which data can be transferred, measured in bytes per second. Memory bandwidth (HBM to compute units) is often the primary performance bottleneck for modern ML workloads.

**Cache Hit**
: When requested data is found in a faster cache level, avoiding access to slower memory. Cache hit rate strongly affects performance for memory-bound workloads.

**Cache Line**
: The minimum unit of data transfer between memory hierarchy levels. Typically 64 bytes on modern CPUs. Accessing a single byte loads an entire cache line.

**Cache Miss**
: When requested data is not in cache and must be fetched from a slower memory level. The cost of a miss depends on which level the data is found (L2, L3, DRAM).

**Compute-Bound**
: A workload where execution time is limited by the rate of arithmetic operations rather than memory bandwidth. Compute-bound kernels can approach peak FLOPS.

**Depthwise Separable Convolution**
: A factorization of standard convolution into depthwise (spatial) and pointwise (channel-mixing) operations. Reduces parameters and compute by a factor of the kernel size.

**DRAM**
: Dynamic Random Access Memory. Main system memory, slower than SRAM caches but with much larger capacity. Typical latency: 50-100 nanoseconds.

**FlashAttention**
: An algorithm for exact attention computation that uses tiling and online softmax to avoid materializing the O(n²) attention matrix. Reduces memory from O(n²) to O(n).

**FLOPS**
: Floating-Point Operations Per Second. A measure of computational throughput. Modern GPUs achieve hundreds of teraFLOPS (10¹² operations/second).

**Fused Kernel**
: A GPU kernel that combines multiple operations into a single pass over data, reducing memory traffic. Example: fusing ReLU into matrix multiply.

**HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)**
: GPU memory with high bandwidth (3+ TB/s on modern GPUs) but limited capacity (40-80GB). The primary memory for large tensors.

**L1/L2/L3 Cache**
: Hierarchical on-chip memory with decreasing speed and increasing size. L1 is fastest (1-4 cycles), L3 is slowest but largest.

**Latency**
: Time to complete a single operation or request. Contrast with throughput (operations per second).

**Locality**
: A property where a function's output depends primarily on nearby inputs. Enables tiling, blocking, and cache-efficient algorithms. Temporal locality (reuse over time) and spatial locality (adjacent access) are the two main forms.

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
: A fine-tuning technique that freezes pretrained weights and adds trainable low-rank matrices. Exploits the observation that weight updates during fine-tuning are approximately low-rank.

**Low-Rank Approximation**
: Approximating a matrix $W \approx AB$ where $A$ and $B$ have lower rank than $W$. Reduces parameters from $mn$ to $(m+n)r$ where $r$ is the rank.

**Memory-Bound**
: A workload where execution time is limited by the rate of data transfer rather than computation. Most ML inference workloads are memory-bound.

**Memory Hierarchy**
: The organization of memory into levels of decreasing speed and increasing capacity: registers → L1 → L2 → L3 → DRAM → SSD → disk.

**Mixture of Experts (MoE)**
: An architecture where only a subset of model parameters are activated for each input. Enables larger models without proportional compute increase.

**Monoid**
: An algebraic structure with an associative operation and identity element. The theoretical foundation for parallel reductions and streaming algorithms.

**Operator Fusion**
: Combining multiple operations into a single kernel to reduce memory traffic. A key optimization in deep learning compilers like torch.compile.

**Prefetching**
: Loading data into cache before it's needed, hiding memory latency. Hardware prefetchers detect streaming access patterns; software can provide explicit hints.

**Quantization**
: Representing numbers with fewer bits (e.g., FP16 instead of FP32, or INT8 instead of FP16). Reduces memory footprint and bandwidth, sometimes with specialized hardware support.

**Roofline Model**
: A visual model showing maximum achievable performance as a function of arithmetic intensity. Performance is bounded by min(peak FLOPS, bandwidth × intensity).

**Redundancy**
: A property where the information content of data is less than its representation size. Enables quantization, compression, caching, and approximation. Shannon's entropy measures true information content.

**Separability**
: A property where a function can be decomposed into simpler, independent components. Enables factorization optimizations like separable filters and low-rank approximations.

**SIMD**
: Single Instruction, Multiple Data. Processing multiple data elements with a single instruction. Essential for efficient vectorized code.

**Sparsity**
: Having many zero or near-zero values in a matrix or tensor. Structured sparsity (e.g., 2:4 patterns) enables hardware acceleration.

**SRAM (Static RAM)**
: Fast on-chip memory used for caches and GPU shared memory. Lower latency than DRAM but limited capacity. GPU shared memory is typically 100-200KB per SM.

**Streaming Algorithm**
: An algorithm that processes data in a single pass, maintaining only a small summary state. Enabled by associative operations with bounded state.

**Symmetry**
: A property where a computation is invariant or equivariant under some transformation. Enables weight sharing (CNNs), Fourier methods, and group equivariant networks. Noether's theorem connects symmetry to conservation laws.

**Tensor Core**
: Specialized hardware for matrix multiply-accumulate operations. Achieves much higher throughput than standard FP32 cores but requires specific data formats.

**Tiling**
: Dividing data into blocks that fit in fast memory, processing each tile entirely before moving to the next. Reduces memory traffic at the cost of code complexity.

**Throughput**
: The number of operations completed per unit time. Contrast with latency (time per operation).

**Working Set**
: The set of data actively being accessed. Performance depends on whether the working set fits in each cache level.
